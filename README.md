sage-replay-parser
==================

A collection of PHP classes to parse replay files from games using the SAGE engine (CnC 3, Red Alert 3, ...)

Also include code to retrive player's stats from the former commandandconquer.com website, purely for archiving purpose since the website has since completely modifier

Note: this code was made several years ago for a gaming website and while it should still work for the most part, it definitely requires some workover
